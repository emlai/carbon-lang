<h2 id="entity">entity</h2>
<p>An <em>entity</em> is a named item with an associated name path, such as a function, type, interface, or namespace. For example, in <code>fn GetTime()</code>, <code>GetTime</code> refers to an entity which is a function.</p>
<h2 id="identifier">identifier</h2>
<p>An <em>identifier</em> is the token which names an entity, and is also used in code to refer to the entity. For example, in <code>fn GetTime()</code>, <code>GetTime</code> is the identifier for the function.</p>
<h2 id="library">library</h2>
<p>A <em>library</em> is a group of files that form an importable API and its implementation. Carbon encourages small libraries, bundled into larger packages. For example, given <code>package Geometry library Shapes;</code>, <code>Shapes</code> is a library in the <code>Geometry</code> package.</p>
<h2 id="name-path">name path</h2>
<p>A <em>name path</em> is the dot-separated identifier list that indicates a relative or full path of a name. For example, given <code>fn GetArea(var Geometry.Circle: x)</code>, <code>Geometry.Circle</code> is a name path. <code>GetArea</code> is also a name path, albeit with only one identifier needed.</p>
<h2 id="namespace">namespace</h2>
<p>A <em>namespace</em> is a entity that contains entities, and may be nested. For example, given a name path of <code>Geometry.Circle</code>, <code>Geometry</code> is a namespace containing <code>Circle</code>.</p>
<h2 id="package">package</h2>
<p>A <em>package</em> is a group of libraries in Carbon, and is the standard unit for distribution. The package name also serves as the root namespace for all name paths in its libraries. The package name should be a single, globally-unique identifier. For example, given <code>package Geometry;</code> in a file, <code>Geometry</code> is the package and root namespace.</p>
