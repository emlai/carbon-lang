<li><p>The sequence of Unicode code points in a source file is partitioned into contiguous subsequences called <em>lexical elements</em>. Formation of lexical elements begins with the first code point in the source file and proceeds in code point order.</p></li>
<li><p>At each step, the longest valid lexical element that can be formed from a prefix of the remaining code points is formed, even if this would result in a failure to form a later lexical element. Repeating this process shall convert the entire source file into lexical elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Valid lexical elements are:</p>
<p>TODO: Add a list of lexical elements once we've decided on them.</p></li>
