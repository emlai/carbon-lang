<p>Some language <a href="../goals.html">goals</a> will have widely-applicable, high-impact, and sometimes non-obvious corollaries. We collect concrete language design principles in this directory as a way to document and clarify these. Principles clarify, but do not supersede, goals and priorities. Principles should be used as a tool in making decisions, and to clarify to contributors how decisions are expected to be made.</p>
<p>A key difference between a principle and the design of a language feature is that a principle should inform multiple designs, whereas a feature's design is typically more focused on achieving a specific goal or set of goals. The principle can help achieve consistency across those multiple designs.</p>
<p>Note that these principles seek to establish both the approaches the project wants to pursue, as well as those we want to exclude.</p>
