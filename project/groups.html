<p>These are groups used by the Carbon Language project, listed here for central tracking.</p>
<p>We use a mix of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups to assist contacting key contributors on appropriate systems:
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub teams</strong></li>
<li><strong>Discord roles</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Google groups</strong>, usually as Google Drive ACLs. We generally won't use these as contact lists, unless specifically mentioned. Please prefer other community forums.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="all-contributors">All contributors</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/people">GitHub organization</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/contributors-with-label-access">GitHub team: Contributors with label access</a>: Mirrors the GitHub organization for write access. <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/tree/trunk/github_tools/update_label_access.py">Manually updated</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://discord.com/app">Discord access</a></li>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/carbon-lang-contributors">Google group</a>: Grants Google Drive access.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="team-specific-access">Team-specific access</h2>
<p>Any team-specific access will typically be managed by a team owner or admin, when somebody joins the respective team.</p>
<h3 id="admins">Admins</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/people?query=role%3Aowner">GitHub owners</a></li>
<li>Discord role: admin</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="carbon-leads">Carbon leads</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/carbon-leads">GitHub team</a></li>
<li>Discord role: carbon-leads</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conduct-team">Conduct team</h3>
<p>For most purposes, the Core team should be contacted about conduct issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/carbon-lang-conduct-team">Google group</a>: Primarily a contact list.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-team">Implementation team</h3>
<p>This team is responsible for development of Carbon's primary, reference implementation and toolchain. It also oversees other related implementation work within the Carbon project, from tooling of the language spec to test suites. There may be some overlap with <a href="#admins">admins</a> -- any issue can be resolved by escalating to the <a href="#carbon-leads">Carbon leads</a>. Notably, this team is <em>not</em> responsible for the <em>design</em> of the language itself, only for its implementation.</p>
