<p>This directory contains current, accepted documentation underpinning Carbon. These documents cover all aspects of Carbon ranging from the project down to detailed designs for specific language features.</p>
<p>If you're trying to learn more about Carbon, we recommend starting at <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/tree/trunk/README.md"><code>/README.md</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>The design of the Carbon language, and the rationale for that design, is documented in the <a href="design/index.html"><code>design/</code> directory</a>. This documentation is intended to support these audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who wish to determine whether Carbon would be the right choice to use for a project compared to other existing languages.</li>
<li>People working on the evolution of the Carbon language who wish to understanding the rationale and motivation for existing design decisions.</li>
<li>People working on a specification or implementation of the Carbon language who need a detailed understanding of the intended design.</li>
<li>People writing Carbon code who wish to understand why the language rules are the way they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is in contrast to <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/tree/trunk/proposals/README.md">proposals</a>, which document the individual decisions that led to this design (along with other changes to the Carbon project), including the rationale and alternatives considered.</p>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>The <a href="project/index.html"><code>project/</code> directory</a> contains project-related documentation for Carbon, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="project/goals.html">goals</a>, and the <a href="project/principles/index.html">principles</a> and <a href="project/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> derived from those goals,</li>
<li>how the project works, and</li>
<li>how to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guides">Guides</h2>
<p>The <a href="guides/index.html"><code>guides/</code> directory</a> contains <strong>to-be-written</strong> end-user documentation for developers writing programs in Carbon.</p>
<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p>The <a href="spec/"><code>spec/</code> directory</a> contains the <strong>to-be-written</strong> formal specification of the Carbon language. This is for implementers of compilers or other tooling. This is intended to complement the interactive <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/tree/trunk/explorer/">language explorer tool</a>.</p>
