<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>This is a skeletal design, added to support <a href="index.html">the overview</a>. It should not be treated as accepted by the core team; rather, it is a placeholder until we have more time to examine this detail. Please feel welcome to rewrite and update as appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Naming is one of the things that most often requires careful management over time -- things tend to get renamed and moved around.</p>
<p>Carbon provides a fully general name aliasing facility to declare a new name as an alias for a value; everything is a value in Carbon. This is a fully general facility because everything is a value in Carbon, including types.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>alias MyInt = Int;</code></pre>
<p>This creates an alias called <code>MyInt</code> for whatever <code>Int</code> resolves to. Code textually after this can refer to <code>MyInt</code>, and it will transparently refer to <code>Int</code>.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>The syntax here is not at all in a good state yet. We've considered a few alternatives, but they all end up being confusing in some way. We need to figure out a good and clean syntax that can be used here.</p>
