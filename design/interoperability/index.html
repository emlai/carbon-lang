<h2 id="philosophy-and-goals">Philosophy and goals</h2>
<p>The C++ interoperability layer of Carbon allows a subset of C++ APIs to be accessed from Carbon code, and similarly a subset of Carbon APIs to be accessed from C++ code. This requires expressing one language as a subset of the other. Bridge code may be needed to map some APIs into the relevant subset, but the constraints on expressivity should be loose enough to keep the amount of such bridge code sustainable.</p>
