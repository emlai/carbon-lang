<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>This is a skeletal design, added to support <a href="index.html">the overview</a>. It should not be treated as accepted by the core team; rather, it is a placeholder until we have more time to examine this detail. Please feel welcome to rewrite and update as appropriate.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/89">proposal PR 89</a> for context -- that proposal may replace this.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Carbon provides metaprogramming facilities that look similar to regular Carbon code. These are structured, and do not offer inclusion or arbitrary preprocessing of source text such as C/C++ does.</p>
