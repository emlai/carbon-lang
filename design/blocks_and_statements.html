<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>This is a skeletal design, added to support <a href="index.html">the overview</a>. It should not be treated as accepted by the core team; rather, it is a placeholder until we have more time to examine this detail. Please feel welcome to rewrite and update as appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The body or definition of a function is provided by a block of code containing statements, much like in C or C++. The body of a function is also a new, nested scope inside the function's scope (meaning that parameter names are available). Statements within a block are terminated by a semicolon. Each statement can, among other things, be an expression. Here is a trivial example of a function definition using a block of statements:</p>
<pre><code>fn Foo() {
  Bar();
  Baz();
}</code></pre>
<p>Statements can also themselves be a block of statements, which provide scopes and nesting:</p>
<pre><code>fn Foo() {
  Bar();
  {
    Baz();
  }
}</code></pre>
